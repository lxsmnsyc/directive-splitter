### General Configuration and Output

The following are the list of configuration that can be accepted by the `compile` function:

```js
import { compile } from 'dismantle';

const result = await compile(
  // The full path to file
  path,
  // The contents of the file
  code,
  {
    /**
     * Newly produced modules appends an specific "key"
     * combined with the instanctiation number 
     * e.g. `/path/to/file.ts?example=0.ts
     * 
     * You can use this in bundlers to know how to
     * specifically load/transform the module
     */
    key: 'example',
    /**
     * Mode of compilation.
     * 
     * `server` is the mode that preserves the newly
     * produced function for split functions/blocks.
     * 
     * `client` omits the produced functions.
     */
    mode: 'server', // or 'client'
    /**
     * Only use of this configuration is to allow
     * generated function IDs (used for registration)
     * to have descriptive names
     */

    /**
     * Array of defined directives
     */
    directives: [
      {
        // Value of the directive
        value: 'use server',
        /**
         * Which function to import and call
         * to handle the newly produced function
         * 
         * This function is called at top-level
         * and as a module side-effect.

         * the same way like in `directives`
         */

         * or not.
         *

         * and only the function argument gets replaced.
         * 
         * Setting to `false` means that the function call is removed
