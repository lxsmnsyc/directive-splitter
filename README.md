### General Configuration and Output

The following are the list of configuration that can be accepted by the `compile` function:

```js
import { compile } from 'dismantle';

const result = await compile(
  /**
   * The full path to file
   */
  path,
  /**
   * The contents of the file
   */
  code,
  {
    /**
     * Newly produced modules appends an specific "key"
     * combined with the instanctiation number 
     * e.g. `/path/to/file.ts?example=0.ts
     * 
     * You can use this in bundlers to know how to
     * specifically load/transform the module
     */
    key: 'example',
    /**
     * Mode of compilation.
     * 
     * `server` is the mode that preserves the newly
     * produced function for split functions/blocks.
     * 
     * `client` omits the produced functions.
     */
    mode: 'server', // or 'client'
    /**
     * Only use of this configuration is to allow
     * generated function IDs (used for registration)

        value: 'use server',

         * to handle the newly produced function

### Internal functions contract

> [!INFO]
> The terms "server" and "client" are metaphors: "server" signifies where the function exists and is called
> remotely, "client" is where the function call request comes from.

#### Directives

An internal function for directives are called on top-level. This behavior is to allow the function to be registered on a user-based implementation. The registration's purpose is to allow mapping the function in the "server" from a "client" request.

```js
export function myInternalFunc(
  /**
   * ID of the function
   * 
   * Use this for mapping to the function's instance
   */
  id,
  /**
   * The function to be managed. You can do
   * whatever you want here.
   * 
   * The functions arguments is composed of the "closure" variables.
   */
  func,
) {
  /**
   * Registration stuff goes here
   */

  /**
   * The newly returned function.
   * 
   * You can choose to return the `func` if you want.
   */
  return newFunc;
}
```

On the "client" side, the API required is almost similar except that the function only accepts the `id`.

Here's how an example output would look like:

```js
// server.js
import { myInternalFunc } from 'my-example/server';
import root from '/path/to/file.ts?example=0';
export default myInternalFunc('<unique id>', root);

// client.js
import { myInternalFunc } from 'my-example/server';
import root from '/path/to/file.ts?example=0';
export default myInternalFunc('<unique id>');
```

#### Function Calls

A bit similar to the directives, with the exception of how the function definition can decide
if the original call must be retained or replaced by the new function as a whole.

This is useful for deciding whether or not you wanted a function or a side-effect.

```js
import { lazy$ } from 'my-example';

async function foo() {
  const result = await lazy$(() => {
    return 'foo';
  });

  console.log(result); // 'foo'
}
```
